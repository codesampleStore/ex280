About this Hands-on Lab

The Red Hat Certified Specialist in OpenShift Administration exam tests your knowledge, skills, and ability to create, configure, and manage a cloud application platform using Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform. Now that youâ€™ve gone through all the objectives, it is time to test your newfound knowledge on the practice exam to prepare for the real exam and hopefully guide you to earning your Red Hat Certified Specialist in OpenShift Administration! In this lab, you will be asked to download OpenShift on CodeReady Containers and set up your cluster for the exam. After that, you will perform a series of tasks similar to what you will be asked to do in the actual exam. Good luck, and please use this practice exam as many times as you need before taking the exam.

        Modify the quota.yaml file with the following values:
            Max number of pods = 3
            Max amount of memory = 2 GB
            Max number of replication controllers = 2

            Max number of pods = 4
            Requested cpus = 1
            Requested memory = 1 GB
            Requested Ephemeral storage = 2 GB
            Limit cpus to 4
            Limit memory to 4 GB
            Limit Ephemeral storage to 8 GB
        Create resource limit and apply it to the Twinkies project.

Application Creation and Management

        Note: Use https://github.com/sclorg/cakephp-ex example app to create applications

        Create test-app1, test-app2, test-app3, test-app4, and test-app5 projects.
        Create an application named cake and make sure it is accessible to the outside world in project test-app1.
        Create an application using a route called twinkiesforall in the test-app2 project.
        Create an application using a secured route called mytwinkie in the test-app3 project. Use self-signed cert from lab repo to secure the route (the links are provided on the lab page).
        Create an application that can use the dont-tell secret project test-app4.
        Create a secret called dont_tell in the test-app4 project. Download the secret.yaml file (using the link provided on the lab page).
            Populate with the user dXN1ci1uYW11 and password dGHcz4dvCmQ=.
        Create a service account called madison in the test-app5 project.
        Create an application that can be edited by the madison service account in the test-app5 project.
        Manually scale the application in the test-app2 project to 2 pods.
        Set an autoscaler for min of 1 pod and a max of 3 pods based of 75% CPU utilization for the application in the test-app5 project.
